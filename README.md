**Worm** é uma modificação das regras de Cairn, escrito por [Yochai Gal](https://newschoolrevolution.com), vagamente inspirada em Tormenta20 com o objetivo de ser um conjunto sólido de regras fáceis de aprender e arbitrar. A geração de personagens é rápida e aleatória, aventuras são tensas e recompensam exploração cuidadosa, e o combate é descomplicado e mortal.

Cairn is an adventure game about exploring a dark and mysterious Wood filled with strange folk, hidden treasure, and unspeakable monstrosities. Character generation is quick and random, adventures are tense and reward careful exploration, and combat is frantic and deadly. The game was written by [Yochai Gal](https://newschoolrevolution.com). There are two editions (see sidebar) both of which are rules-compatible.
